      title: 'Getting Started with React and Vite',
      content: `React and Vite make a powerful combination for modern web development. Vite provides lightning-fast development experience with hot module replacement, while React gives us the component-based architecture we love.

In this blog, I'll share my experience building applications with this stack and some best practices I've learned along the way.

## Why Vite?

Vite offers several advantages over traditional build tools:
- **Fast cold start**: No bundling required during development
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Instant updates without losing state  
- **Optimized builds**: Production builds are highly optimized
- **Rich ecosystem**: Great plugin ecosystem and framework integration

## Setting Up Your Project

Getting started is incredibly simple:

\`\`\`bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

And you're ready to go! The development server starts in milliseconds, not seconds.

## Best Practices

Here are some tips I've learned:

1. **Use TypeScript**: Even for small projects, TypeScript catches errors early
2. **Leverage Vite plugins**: There are plugins for almost everything
3. **Optimize imports**: Use dynamic imports for code splitting
4. **Configure your IDE**: Set up your editor for the best development experience

## Conclusion

React + Vite is an excellent choice for modern web applications. The developer experience is fantastic, and the performance benefits are real.

      title: 'The Future of Web Development: Trends to Watch',
      content: `The web development landscape is constantly evolving. As we move forward, several trends are shaping how we build applications and user experiences.

## 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Renaissance

With frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, and SvelteKit, SSR is making a strong comeback. The benefits are clear:
- Better SEO performance
- Faster initial page loads
- Improved user experience

## 2. Edge Computing and CDNs

Moving computation closer to users is becoming increasingly important:
- Reduced latency
- Better global performance
- More resilient applications

## 3. WebAssembly (WASM) Adoption

WebAssembly is opening new possibilities:
- Near-native performance in browsers
- Bringing other languages to the web
- Complex applications running client-side

## 4. AI-Powered Development Tools

AI is revolutionizing how we code:
- Intelligent code completion
- Automated testing
- Code review assistance
- Bug detection and fixes

## 5. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

PWAs continue to bridge the gap between web and native:
- Offline functionality
- Push notifications
- Native-like experiences
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Conclusion

The future of web development is exciting and full of possibilities. Staying updated with these trends will help us build better, more efficient applications.

      title: 'Building Responsive Layouts with Tailwind CSS',
      content: `Tailwind CSS has revolutionized how I approach styling. Its utility-first approach makes building responsive layouts intuitive and maintainable.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

After years of writing custom CSS and using various frameworks, Tailwind feels like a breath of fresh air:

- **Utility-first**: No more naming classes or worrying about CSS specificity
- **Responsive design**: Built-in responsive modifiers make mobile-first design easy
- **Consistency**: Design system built right into your utility classes
- **Performance**: Only the styles you use get included in your final bundle

## Responsive Design Made Easy

One of Tailwind's strongest features is its approach to responsive design:

\`\`\`html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  <!-- Content automatically adapts to screen size -->
</div>
\`\`\`

The mobile-first approach means you start with mobile styles and add larger screen styles as needed.

## Common Patterns

Here are some responsive patterns I use frequently:

### Navigation
- Mobile: Hamburger menu
- Desktop: Horizontal navigation

### Cards
- Mobile: Single column
- Tablet: Two columns  
- Desktop: Three or four columns

### Typography
- Mobile: Smaller, more compact text
- Desktop: Larger, more spacious text

## Tips for Success

1. **Start mobile-first**: Design for small screens first
2. **Use the responsive prefixes**: sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:
3. **Leverage Tailwind's spacing scale**: Consistent spacing across breakpoints
4. **Test on real devices**: Emulators are good, but real devices are better

## Conclusion

Tailwind CSS makes responsive design approachable and maintainable. Once you get used to the utility-first approach, you'll wonder how you ever built layouts without it.

Give it a try on your next project â€“ you might be surprised how much you enjoy it!`,
